add an optional console log for debugging if needed...
add a section so that I can change the match names. Additionally it shouldn't be specifying the camera name, or it can but then it must display all possible files to be written in a box so that if there are a lot of cameras in the future it will scale in the box and not mess up the page format
add recordings to a subdirectories of their own
disable reconnecting client and server side during recordings. can only reconnect if recording is turned off to disable stupid people

add a feature such that if they don't play the start sound, at least hear the teleop bell, then add buffer and then listen for the auto end
when leaving the page temporarily, it cuts the connection but then trying to go back the cameras refuse to connect core.
add a noise reducer so that the main sound can be amplified and focused on.
